To run this project in your environment you must have this wonderful Plutonian artifact called [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

 Download the code project. You can use the **Download ZIP** button or clone it if you already have installed [git](https://git-scm.com/) .

Open a terminal and go inside the folder with the code.

Finally open your web browser on `http://localhost:8000/` and *...voil√°! super ultra mega enjoy it!*
